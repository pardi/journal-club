# Research interest description (used for semantic similarity)
research_interests: |
  I am interested in robotics manipulation, computer vision for 3D scene understanding,
  and machine learning approaches for robotic control. Specifically, I focus on dexterous
  manipulation, grasp planning, visual servoing, and reinforcement learning for robotics.
