**Authors:** Zhixian Xie, Yu Xiang, Michael Posa, Wanxin Jin

**Published:** 2026-01-16

**Categories:** cs.RO

**Relevance Score:** 0.720
 (Keyword matches: 2)

**Topic:** Robotics Manipulation

**Abstract:** A key challenge in contact-rich dexterous manipulation is the need to jointly reason over geometry, kinematic constraints, and intricate, nonsmooth contact dynamics. End-to-end visuomotor policies bypass this structure, but often require large amounts of data, transfer poorly from simulation to real...
