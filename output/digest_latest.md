## 1. [UniLiPs: Unified LiDAR Pseudo-Labeling with Geometry-Grounded Dynamic Scene Decomposition](http://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05105v1)

**Authors:** Filippo Ghilotti, Samuel Brucker, Nahku Saidy, Matteo Matteucci, Mario Bijelic, et al. (+1 more)

**Published:** 2026-01-08

**Categories:** cs.CV

**Relevance Score:** 0.378

**Topic:** Computer Vision

**Abstract:** Unlabeled LiDAR logs, in autonomous driving applications, are inherently a gold mine of dense 3D geometry hiding in plain sight - yet they are almost useless without human labels, highlighting a dominant cost barrier for autonomous-perception research. In this work we tackle this bottleneck by lever...

**Topic:** Computer Vision

**Abstract:** We present MOSAIC-GS, a novel, fully explicit, and computationally efficient approach for high-fidelity dynamic scene reconstruction from monocular videos using Gaussian Splatting. Monocular reconstruction is inherently ill-posed due to the lack of sufficient multiview constraints, making accurate r...

**Topic:** Computer Vision

**Abstract:** Fully convolutional networks have become the backbone of modern medical imaging due to their ability to learn multi-scale representations and perform end-to-end inference. Yet their potential for slice-to-volume reconstruction (SVR), the task of jointly estimating 3D anatomy and slice poses from mis...

**Authors:** Zirui Wu, Zeren Jiang, Martin R. Oswald, Jie Song

**Published:** 2026-01-08

**Categories:** cs.CV

**Relevance Score:** 0.355

**Topic:** Computer Vision

**Abstract:** Feed-forward view synthesis models predict a novel view in a single pass with minimal 3D inductive bias. Existing works encode cameras as Plücker ray maps, which tie predictions to the arbitrary world coordinate gauge and make them sensitive to small camera transformations, thereby undermining geome...

**Topic:** Computer Vision

**Abstract:** Embodied question answering (EQA) in 3D environments often requires collecting context that is distributed across multiple viewpoints and partially occluded. However, most recent vision--language models (VLMs) are constrained to a fixed and finite set of input views, which limits their ability to ac...
