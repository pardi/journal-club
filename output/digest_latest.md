## 1. [Learning Dynamic Collaborative Network for Semi-supervised 3D Vessel Segmentation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07377v1)

**Authors:** Jiao Xu, Xin Chen, Lihe Zhang

**Published:** 2026-01-12

**Categories:** cs.CV, cs.AI

**Relevance Score:** 0.399

**Topic:** Computer Vision

**Abstract:** In this paper, we present a new dynamic collaborative network for semi-supervised 3D vessel segmentation, termed DiCo. Conventional mean teacher (MT) methods typically employ a static approach, where the roles of the teacher and student models are fixed. However, due to the complexity of 3D vessel d...

## 5. [MoE3D: A Mixture-of-Experts Module for 3D Reconstruction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05208v2)

**Authors:** Zichen Wang, Ang Cao, Liam J. Wang, Jeong Joon Park

**Published:** 2026-01-08

**Categories:** cs.CV

**Relevance Score:** 0.393
 (Keyword matches: 1)

**Topic:** Computer Vision

**Abstract:** We propose a simple yet effective approach to enhance the performance of feed-forward 3D reconstruction models. Existing methods often struggle near depth discontinuities, where standard regression losses encourage spatial averaging and thus blur sharp boundaries. To address this issue, we introduce...

## 6. [On the Non-decoupling of Supervised Fine-tuning and Reinforcement Learning in Post-training](http://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07389v1)

**Authors:** Xueyan Niu, Bo Bai, Wei Han, Weixi Zhang

**Published:** 2026-01-12

**Categories:** cs.LG, cs.AI, cs.IT

**Relevance Score:** 0.389
 (Keyword matches: 2)

**Topic:** Machine Learning

**Abstract:** Post-training of large language models routinely interleaves supervised fine-tuning (SFT) with reinforcement learning (RL). These two methods have different objectives: SFT minimizes the cross-entropy loss between model outputs and expert responses, while RL maximizes reward signals derived from hum...
